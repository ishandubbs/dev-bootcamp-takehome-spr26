                    <p>My name is Ishan Roy and I am a second-year Computer Engineering major at Georgia Tech.</p>
                    <p>I am from Lawrenceville, GA, and one thing I am passionate about relating to social good is giving back to the community and providing them with necessary resources.</p>
                    <p>I did this by volunteering at FOBANA in 2025 where we helped raised access for women's voices in the Bangladeshi community, as well as organizing a soccer charity match through Invincible Incorporated, donating the money raised to a homeless shelter.</p>
                    <p>In my free time, I love to swim, hang out with friends and family, listen to music, and play video games.</p>
